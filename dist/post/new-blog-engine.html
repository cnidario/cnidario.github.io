decided to make my own ‘blog engine’. Well, it’s just a Makefile and
some scripts. I rather prefer the simplicity of this approach to a more
featureful system because the price for that is a lot of hidden
complexity.<p>I use pandoc for rendering markdown to html, and a filter written in
lua for piping the code blocks into pygmentize. Also some awk one liners
to generate the list of posts. The styling is minimal, I use water.css
with minimal tweaks, to taste. Finally, I minify all the output.<p>Basically it’s just that. Very simple and lightweight.</main><footer>made by me</footer>
