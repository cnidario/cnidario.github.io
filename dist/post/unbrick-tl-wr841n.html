the brand new one that came with the ISP company.<p>Reasons to love the TL-WR841N include: - It does the job fairly well
(well, sometimes it struggles to manage a lot of traffic, but it usually
works well). - It can be flashed with a <a href=dd-wrt.com>DD-WRT</a>
firmware. - It is small and low power while doing all the things I need.
It has a nominal power of 5.4W while in my new Zyxel VMG8924 is 24W!
more than 4 times. Unfortunately, when trying to update my custom DD-WRT
I’ve bricked it and became unbootable.<h2 id=how-to-unbrick>How to unbrick</h2><p>Usually, the last and only resort to save the life of these devices
used to be opening the case and plug some sort of USB to UART/JTAG/… in
a special socket in the PCB and to the computer and reflash the original
stock firmware.<p><strong>But</strong> this TL-WR841N has an amazing new feature, the
bootloader comes with a fallback mechanism and we only need to mount a
TFTP server.<h2 id=steps>Steps</h2><p>This instructions are almost the same for this model versions v8, v9,
v10, v11 and v12. Just change vXX in the name of the firmware file.
<strong>Be sure to download the specific version file
though!!</strong><ol type=1><li>Download the latest official version from the TP-LINK <a href=www.tp-link.com/es/support/download/tl-wr841n/v11/#Firmware>page</a>.
Looking the stick at the back of the router I can see the the exact
model and version, in my case v11.1.<li>Unzip and rename the .bin to wr841nv11_tp_recovery.bin (in my case,
check the <a href=https://oldwiki.archive.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#tftp_recovery_via_bootloader_for_v8_v9_v10_v11_v12>OpenWRT
