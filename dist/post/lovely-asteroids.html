Even not having ever touched Lua, it
was very straightforward to go. It took me maybe 15 hours split into two
days, plus some more hours, days after, polishing it. It’s mostly a
single file plus assets and a vector utility library.<p>Getting into code is pretty fast, in Arch <code>pacman -S love</code>
and you can start coding. Aswell as running the game. Just
<code>love .</code> from the game directory. Could be easier? :)<p>You need then 1 file, <code>main.lua</code> containing 3 functions: -
<code>love.load()</code> - <code>love.update(dt)</code> -
<code>love.draw(dt)</code><p>Let’s see an example which draws a rectangle<pre><code class=lua><div class=highlight><pre><span></span><span class=kr>function</span> <span class=nc>love</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=nf>draw</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>dt</span><span class=p>)</span>
    <span class=n>love</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>graphics</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>setColor</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=mf>0.5</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=mf>0.1</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=mf>0.2</span><span class=p>)</span>
    <span class=n>love</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>graphics</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>rectangle</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s1>&#39;fill&#39;</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=mi>100</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=mi>100</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=mi>250</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=mi>400</span><span class=p>)</span>
<span class=kr>end</span>
</pre></div></code></pre><p>You can even do without load and update. If you now
<code>love .</code> you will see this ugly rectangle. <img src=../img/lovely-asteroids-1.png alt="Image of a rectangle drew by LÖVE"><h2 id=asteroids>Asteroids</h2><p>It’s a very simple clone with program generated graphics. Doesn’t
have a menu, just get into action.<p>Features of the game - Spawn & generation of random asteroids
(ellipse based, some look really ugly, had to fix 8). - Collision of
asterois with bullets & player. - Asteroids have a ‘dimension’, when
you destroy one with dimension > 1 it explodes into multiple of
dimension-1. - Sounds! (<a href=https://sfxr.me/>with sfxr.me!
fun!</a>) - Lose condition. - No win condition <em>BUT</em> you have a
score. - Particle effects and random bizarre juicing, especially
explosions. - About 400 lines of spaguetti code.<p>I tried also to export it to Javascript but failed miserably. There
are some attempts in GitHub to port it through Emscripten but I couldn’t
manage to make it to work after some tries.<p>Probably more fun to code than to play, anyway…<p>Enjoy coding!<figure><img src=../img/lovely-asteroids-2.png alt="Image of the game"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Image of the game</figcaption></figure></main><footer>made by me</footer>
